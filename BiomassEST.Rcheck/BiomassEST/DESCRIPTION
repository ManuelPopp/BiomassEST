Description: The BiomassEST package provides simple functions to estimate tree biomass from easy-to-obtain data such as diameter at breast height, root collar diameter, or tree height. The functions rely on parameters obtained from peer-reviewed papers (use the BiomassEST::cite.datasource() function to display source paper citations).
